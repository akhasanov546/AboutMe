<h1>About Me: Azam Khasanov</h1>
<br>
<p>Hello, my name is, Azamdzhon Khasanov and I'm a 9th grader at Millard North High School.
   At Millard, I have a couple of excellent friends they are Bill, Thanish (Lil T'), Thomas, and Alex.
   I'm a huge soccer fan, my favorite clubs are <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/">  FC Barcelona</a> and the Russia National Team, also, if you couldn't
   guess I enjoy watching soccer, but I have never played for a team. Instead, I partake in swimming, although
   I'm not the fastest I appreciate how the sport can give you good comradeship. When I'm not at school or swimming,
   I like to read and play basketball with my friends. Finally, I enjoy biking in my free time around my
   neighborhood or Zorinsky Lake.</p>
